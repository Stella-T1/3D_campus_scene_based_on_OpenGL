# 🏫 3D Campus Scene Based on OpenGL

This project presents a 3D campus scene developed using **OpenGL** and **C/C++**, aiming to simulate a simplified university environment through computer graphics. The scene features key architectural elements such as buildings, trees, walkways, and sky effects, rendered using OpenGL primitives and transformations.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 🧱 **OpenGL Graphics**: Built from scratch using OpenGL (GLUT/GLU) without game engines.
- 🏢 **Campus Layout**: Includes buildings, roads, squares, trees, and other campus elements.
- 🎥 **Camera Control**: Basic keyboard-based interaction to navigate the scene (e.g., rotation, zoom).
- 🌈 **Visual Effects**: Colored lighting, shadows, and animation-ready structure.
- 🧩 **Modular Code**: Scene elements organized into reusable drawing functions.

## 🎮 Controls

- `W/A/S/D`: Move camera view forward/left/back/right
- Arrow keys: Rotate camera
- `Q/E`: Zoom in/out (if implemented)
- `Esc`: Exit the scene

## 🧱 Rendered Objects

- 🏫 **Buildings**: Cuboid structures with textures or solid colors
- 🌲 **Trees**: Cone + cylinder combinations
- 🛣️ **Roads/Walkways**: Grid-aligned planes with lighting
- 🌀 **Skybox/Background**: Simulated with colored planes or a gradient backdrop
- 🟫 **Ground**: Large green plane with grid layout
